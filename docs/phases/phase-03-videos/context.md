**Capabilities** (literal, `docs/project-plan.md`):

- Serviço de armazenamento de arquivos (vídeos e thumbnails)
- Serviço de processamento em segundo plano (filas)
- Upload de vídeos com suporte a arquivos de até 10GB sem impacto na performance
- Pré-cadastro automático do vídeo como rascunho ao iniciar o upload
- Processamento automático do vídeo após upload (extração de duração e metadados)
- Geração automática de thumbnail a partir de um frame do vídeo
- URL única por vídeo, sem conflito com outros vídeos
- Reprodução via streaming (sem necessidade de download completo)

**Out of scope:** _Not specified in `docs/project-plan.md`._

**Deliverables:** upload de até 10GB funcional, processamento automático do vídeo, streaming funcionando, URLs únicas geradas.

**Affected subprojects:**

- `nestjs-project` — API, worker e infraestrutura Docker do backend

**Deferred subprojects:** _None._

**Sequencing notes:** Depende de: Fase 01, Fase 02

**Supplementary constraints** (`docs/phase-03-videos-instrucoes.md`):

- Esta é uma entrega exclusivamente de backend; a interface de vídeo no `next-frontend/` está fora do escopo.
- A entrega abrange API, módulo de vídeos, worker de FFmpeg, object storage, fila e infraestrutura correspondente no Docker Compose.
- O object storage é S3-compatible, com MinIO local; continuam em aberto a organização de buckets/chaves e os contratos de upload resumable/multipart.
- O vídeo pertence a um canal e persiste identificação, título, status, chaves de storage, duração, metadados e identificador público único.
- O ciclo mínimo de status é rascunho, processando, pronto e erro.
- Streaming deve suportar entrega parcial sem download completo; o plano deve especificar o contrato de Range/`206 Partial Content`.
- Storage, fila e worker devem subir como serviços reais no Compose e ser exercitados nos níveis de teste adequados.
- O plano final deve especificar Data Model, API Contracts, Authorization Matrix, Error Catalog, Events/Messages, Dependency Map e Deliverables.

**Neighbors (for boundary detection only):**

- **Phase 02:** Cadastro, Login e Gerenciamento de Conta — depende de: Fase 01
- **Phase 04:** Gerenciamento de Vídeos e Canal — depende de: Fase 02, Fase 03

## Decisions Detail

### phase-03-videos/TD-01

**Recommendation:** it reuses the object store's native resume/parallelism primitives, keeps media bytes outside NestJS, and avoids introducing a separate tus service while the API retains control of identity, authorization, keys, and completion.
**Libraries:** `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`

### phase-03-videos/TD-02

**Recommendation:** it honors the fixed MinIO/S3-compatible architecture, keeps object naming independent of user input, and gives multipart, processing retries, lifecycle cleanup, streaming, and future reprocessing stable keys without multiplying infrastructure configuration.
**Libraries:** `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`

### phase-03-videos/TD-03

**Recommendation:** the architecture already calls for a dedicated queue, and BullMQ offers the best NestJS 11 fit plus the progress, retry, concurrency, and worker-isolation primitives needed by FFmpeg without introducing AMQP-level plumbing.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/bullmq`, `bullmq`

### phase-03-videos/TD-04

**Recommendation:** it satisfies the explicit worker/container requirement, protects API responsiveness, supports independent concurrency and restarts, and reuses current NestJS 11 conventions without turning the HTTP application into the worker runtime.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-05

**Recommendation:** it closes the only loss window between upload completion and queue publication while accepting BullMQ's real delivery semantics and keeping retries safe through persisted state and deterministic outputs.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-06

**Recommendation:** it implements the required database lifecycle, lets the draft receive a stable identity before bytes arrive, preserves all multipart resume data, and leaves Phase 04 visibility independent.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-07

**Recommendation:** it produces a broadly playable streaming artifact and the required metadata/thumbnail with one bounded pipeline, while deferring HLS rendition complexity.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-03-videos/TD-08

**Recommendation:** it preserves API authorization without placing video bytes on the NestJS path and remains a clean origin contract that a CDN can front later without changing object ownership or processing outputs.
**Libraries:** `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`

### phase-03-videos/TD-09

**Recommendation:** it preserves the repository's UUID relational convention while providing the dedicated URL identifier required by the phase; a unique index and retry turn probabilistic generation into a collision-safe database contract.
**Libraries:** `nanoid`

## Inherited Decisions Detail

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/config) — Official, core-team-maintained, guaranteed NestJS 11 compatibility. The `registerAs()` factory pattern solves the TypeORM CLI sharing problem: the factory function can be imported as a plain function by `data-source.ts` while also serving as a DI injection token inside NestJS. Building a custom module recreates solved functionality; third-party packages carry maintenance risk.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/config@^4.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (Joi) — First-class integration with `@nestjs/config` via `validationSchema`, requiring zero custom wiring. Handles string-to-number coercion natively. Using a different tool for env validation vs. request validation is reasonable — env config is validated once at startup, DTOs are validated per-request. Zod is elegant but adds a third validation paradigm to the project.

**Libraries:** `joi@^17.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option B (Namespaced/grouped with registerAs) — The project roadmap explicitly calls for auth, email, and storage in upcoming phases. Namespaced configs provide clear file boundaries per domain, typed injection via `ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>`, and natural scalability. The `registerAs()` factory is dual-purpose: DI token inside NestJS and plain importable function for `data-source.ts`. Initial files for Phase 01: `src/config/database.config.ts`, `src/config/app.config.ts`.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option A (Shared registerAs factory) — Natural outcome of choosing `@nestjs/config` with `registerAs`. The factory is already callable by design. `data-source.ts` imports it, calls `dotenv.config()`, then calls the factory. Zero duplication, minimal code, no extra abstraction.

**Libraries:** `dotenv` (transitive via `@nestjs/config`)

### phase-02-auth/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Argon2id — For a greenfield project in 2026, Argon2id is the OWASP-recommended choice. The native build dependency is a one-time Docker setup cost. The project has no legacy constraints favoring bcrypt. OWASP minimum: 19MiB memory, 2 iterations.

**Libraries:** `argon2@^0.41.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/passport) — The project plan includes only email/password auth for now, but the plugin architecture costs little and future phases may add social login. Aligns with official NestJS docs, making onboarding and maintenance easier.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Refresh Token Rotation) — Provides the strongest security model with automatic theft detection. The DB write overhead is acceptable for a video platform (auth refresh is infrequent vs. video operations). PostgreSQL is already in the stack, so no new infrastructure needed. Race conditions can be mitigated with a short grace period for the old token.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option B (Random Opaque Tokens in DB) — Revocability is important: when a user requests a new password reset, previous tokens should be invalidated. The DB table is trivial to implement, and the tokens table can also serve future needs (e.g., API keys). Keeps email tokens decoupled from the JWT auth system.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs-modules/mailer) — Best NestJS integration with minimal boilerplate. Supports SMTP (matching the architecture diagram), works with MailHog/Mailpit for local development without external dependencies, and scales to any SMTP provider in production. Template engine support (Handlebars) simplifies email formatting. No vendor lock-in.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs-modules/mailer@^2.x`, `handlebars@^4.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Option A (class-validator + class-transformer) — This is a backend-only project (no shared schemas with frontend), so Zod's single-source-of-truth advantage is less impactful. class-validator is the documented NestJS approach, and the project already uses decorators extensively (TypeORM entities, NestJS DI). Fewer integration surprises with NestJS 11.

**Libraries:** `class-validator@^0.14.x`, `class-transformer@^0.5.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Option A (Custom Domain Exception Filter) — Provides machine-readable error codes that the Next.js frontend can switch on, without the overhead of RFC 9457's URI-based type system. The project is single-consumer (first-party frontend), so a simple `{ statusCode, error, message }` format with domain codes balances clarity and simplicity. The custom filter cost is low — two small files.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-08

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/throttler) — Native NestJS integration is decisive: the guard system allows scoping rate limiting to `AuthModule` only via module-level `APP_GUARD`, with `@SkipThrottle()` for exemptions. The project is single-instance with no distributed requirements, so in-memory storage is sufficient. Using express-rate-limit would bypass NestJS's DI and guard lifecycle for no clear benefit.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/throttler@^6.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-09

**Recommendation:** Option B (Opaque) — Since DB lookup is mandatory (TD-03), JWT signature adds no security value. Opaque tokens are shorter, leak no data, and are simpler to generate.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-10

**Recommendation:** Option A — The platform is a video sharing service with URL-based channel handles. A strict `[a-z0-9_]` allowlist is the simplest and most portable choice: no extra dependencies, no edge cases around hyphen positioning, and the `user_<random>` fallback provides a valid handle even for extreme email prefixes. Hyphens can always be added in a future iteration if user feedback justifies it.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Architectural fit.** The strict-BFF model in `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` already nominates the Route Handler as the only NestJS caller; cookie-based sessions are the natural match, and Auth.js's framework adds layers between the BFF and the cookie that buy nothing because the backend is the auth authority — Auth.js's value (DB adapters, OAuth providers, magic-link, `getServerSession` helpers) is mostly unused in this configuration. (2) **Smaller blast radius.** A ~50-LOC session helper is grep-friendly, debuggable, and test-friendly via the existing MSW+BFF integration test pattern; a misconfigured Auth.js callback is a longer fault-isolation loop. (3) **Compatibility with Next.js 16 / React 19.** Built-in `next/headers` `cookies()` is the canonical primitive both runtimes already use; Auth.js v5 versions track Next.js majors with a lag, adding compatibility risk that Option A does not have. Option C is rejected as unsafe (`localStorage` for refresh tokens) and architecturally regressive (loses RSC personalization).

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Defense in depth on the cookie content** — `httpOnly` blocks JS, encryption blocks accidental log/proxy inspection; the marginal cost is one ~3KB dep. (2) **Single cookie to manage** simplifies logout (one `session.destroy()` call) and avoids the orphan-cookie failure mode of Option A. (3) **Room to carry minimal user metadata** (`userId`, `email`, `channelSlug`) lets `app/layout.tsx` RSC render the authenticated chrome (avatar, channel name) without a per-render `/auth/me` round-trip — Phase 04+ gains compound here. Option A is a viable downgrade if the team rejects `iron-session` for any reason; the migration A→B (or B→A) is a one-Route-Handler refactor with no test changes downstream because the BFF interface is unchanged. Option C is rejected: it solves a problem (server-side revocation) the project does not have at the cost of infrastructure the project does not own.

**Libraries:** iron-session

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-03

**Recommendation:** The single-flight detail is non-trivial and goes in the helper from day one — tested by MSW with a "two concurrent intercepted upstream calls; one refresh expected" assertion. Option B's client-driven pattern is rejected because it doesn't replace Option A (RSC still needs server-side refresh) — adopting B means doing both. Option C's pre-emptive timer is rejected because the failure modes (multiple tabs, sleep/wake) outweigh the latency saving and force a `"use client"` shell near the root.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Decoupled from TD-05** — works with Route Handlers OR Server Actions; the form code does not change if TD-05 is revisited later. (2) **Aligned with shadcn's canonical form primitive** — the project already commits to `radix-nova` shadcn (`components.json`); `npx shadcn@latest add form` produces react-hook-form wrappers; choosing react-hook-form means using the supported primitive instead of hand-rolling around it. (3) **Zod-first developer ergonomics match the rest of the FE foundation** — `next-frontend-config-base/TD-01` chose Zod 4 for env; the same schemas-as-source-of-truth pattern carries to forms with zero new validator paradigm. Option B is rejected for impedance with shadcn's primitive and for over-investing in progressive-enhancement that the strict-BFF model does not require. Option C is rejected for the per-field boilerplate and the loss of client-side feedback on a project that values quick, type-safe form iteration.

**Libraries:** react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Strict-BFF alignment.** `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` named Route Handlers as the BFF surface; Option A keeps every mutation visible under `app/api/**`. (2) **Test scaffold already exists** — `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` § Testing and `next-frontend-msw-foundation` were authored for Route-Handlers-as-functions; Option A reuses them with zero invention. (3) **Single mutation surface** — Phase 02 sets the precedent for Phases 03–07; uniformity beats per-mutation idiom-picking when the cost of inconsistency compounds (Option C). Option B has real ergonomic appeal for the simplest forms but fragments the BFF surface and forces test-pattern reinvention; if the team later wants progressive enhancement for specific forms, the migration A→B is per-form and doesn't require touching unrelated routes — A is the safer default and the cheaper baseline.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Two reinforcing reasons. (1) **No first-render flicker, no round-trip** — the session is delivered in the same response as the page HTML; the Client Provider hydrates with the correct initial state; users never see "Login" briefly turn into their avatar. (2) **No new BFF endpoint** — the cookie is the source of truth, RSC reads it, the Provider broadcasts it; the BFF surface stays minimal. The `router.refresh()` requirement after mid-session mutations is a small price (one line in the relevant mutation handler) for the structural benefits. Option B is rejected for the double-read-and-flicker; Option C is dominated by Option B and rejected.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **First-paint-correct** — the user sees the right outcome on the first paint, no skeleton, no flicker. (2) **Single integration pattern across both flows** — confirmation is RSC-only; reset is RSC + Client form (TD-04, TD-05 patterns reused) — both share the "RSC owns the token, Client Component owns the input" split. (3) **Email-prefetch behavior** is solved at the backend's idempotent-confirmation level (a small note for `/plan-build` to confirm; not a separate TD). Option B's Route-Handler-as-link-target adds redirects for no clean gain. Option C is dominated.

**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-01

**Recommendation:** É a única opção que preserva as decisões anteriores (`class-validator` em TD-06 de phase-02-auth) sem re-platform; o CLI plugin com `classValidatorShim: true` aproveita os decoradores `class-validator` existentes para inferir schemas, mantendo o boilerplate baixo. Nestia tem mérito técnico real mas o custo de migração do stack de validação inviabiliza-a sem uma decisão upstream de supersede de TD-06. Manual authoring é descartado.

**Libraries:** @nestjs/swagger

**Revisions:**

- 2026-05-12 — Esclarece que o CLI plugin (`classValidatorShim: true`) cobre apenas inferência de schemas de DTOs a partir de `class-validator`; documentação de operações, respostas tipadas por status code, contratos de erro (alinhados ao envelope de phase-02-auth/TD-07) e exemplos exigem decoradores explícitos (`@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@ApiBody`, `@ApiParam`, `@ApiQuery`, `@ApiExtraModels`). _Rationale:_ openapi.json gerado pelo bootstrap atual está genérico — sem detalhes de parâmetros, schemas de retorno por status, nem contratos de erro — porque a base instalada se apoiou só na introspecção automática. Esta revisão fixa que enriquecimento via decoradores explícitos faz parte da Option A escolhida, não é trabalho fora do escopo do TD.

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-02

**Recommendation:** O custo marginal sobre Option A é apenas um npm script (~15 linhas) e o benefício é uma fundação correta para futura integração FE (codegen offline) sem perder a UI interativa que dev/QA usam. Option B sozinho pune a experiência de desenvolvimento em dev/local; Option A sozinho compromete o pipeline de codegen futuro. Combinar é dominante.

**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Alinha com a postura defensiva já estabelecida em phase 02 e não compromete consumidores legítimos (o `openapi.json` commitado em TD-02 cumpre o papel de "spec consultável fora da UI"). Re-abrir como Option A ou C é trivial no futuro se um caso de uso de API pública aparecer.

**Libraries:** —

## Inherited Deferred Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Origin phase | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Telas de frontend | deferred | phase-01-configuracao-base | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha | deferred | phase-02-auth | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| "Confirmação de conta via e-mail com link de ativação" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — UI landing screen de-scoped 2026-05-14; FE confirmation flow (TD-07) picked up by a future phase. BE side unchanged in `phase-02-auth`. |
| "Logout" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — logout button lives inside authenticated chrome (typically Phase 04). Phase 02 still implements POST `/api/auth/logout` (BFF route handler + `session.destroy()`) so the contract is ready when the chrome lands. |
| "Recuperação de senha (destination screen / set-new-password)" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — `/forgot-password` ships this phase sending the e-mail; the reset-password destination screen is absent from Figma → link destination remains a 404 until a later phase delivers the screen via `/screen-inventory` extension run. Documented as a known gap. |
| "Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | a tela de confirmação da conta não será implementada nesta fase corrente, será adiada — the umbrella bullet's full coverage requires the confirmação and reset-password destination screens; both are deferred per Non-UI rows above. The 3 ship-this-phase telas (signup, login, forgot-password) are inventoried and covered by their own verbs; the umbrella bullet itself is deferred to the phase that lands the missing screens. |
